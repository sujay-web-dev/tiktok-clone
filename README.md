Tik-Tok-clone-App-Made-from-Reactjs-with-Firebase-Backend

This project is built with React.js as front end framework and Firebase as a backend.
In this project I have used UseEffect, UseState React Hooks.

Used Component Based Structure for build most UI.

Used react-ticker for moving text infinitely like a newsticker.
used the Material UI for Buttons, Avatar, Icons.
